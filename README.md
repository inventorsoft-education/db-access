# db-access

Your task is to integrate storage of emails from previous task with SQL databases using both pure JDBC API and Hibernate.
You should create a generic interface with all storage operations you do and then provide two implementations for it: one using JDBC and one using Hibernate. 
Please do not keep results in local collection field inside your implementation anymore. If you need to get data from db - do the query!
